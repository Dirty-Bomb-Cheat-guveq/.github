## ⚙️ How to Use & Stay Hidden

1. Choose a **private cheat build**, ideally undetected and untraceable.
2. Use an **external injector (e.g., EXLoader)**—launch, then game.
3. Menu access via `Insert` or `Home`; toggle through features.
4. Keep ESP/radar flicked off when streaming or public match.
5. Keep backup game files and rotate builds often.
6. Play casually—avoid blatant aimbot sprees; flaunt subtlety.

## 🧠 Final Verdict

Even years after release, **Dirty Bomb cheats remain alive**—a combination of *aimbot, ESP, wallhack, no recoil,* and **packet-based damage hacks** deliver an unfair advantage. Public deployments carry risk, but private, stealthy use (with caution) is still viable for the determined.
